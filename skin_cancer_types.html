    <h1>Types of Skin Cancer Detected</h1>

    <div class="type">
        <h2>Malignant Skin Cancer</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Malignant skin cancer</strong> refers to types of skin cancer that are harmful, invasive, and potentially life-threatening if left untreated. These cancers arise from abnormal and uncontrolled growth of skin cells, often triggered by DNA damage due to UV radiation.
        </p>
    
        <h3>üß™ Types of Malignant Skin Cancers:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Melanoma</strong> ‚Äì The most dangerous and aggressive type; can spread rapidly to internal organs.</li>
            <li><strong>Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)</strong> ‚Äì The most common, slow-growing, and rarely spreads, but can damage surrounding tissue if untreated.</li>
            <li><strong>Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)</strong> ‚Äì Can be more aggressive than BCC and has a higher chance of spreading if not treated early.</li>
            <li><strong>Merkel Cell Carcinoma</strong> ‚Äì A rare but highly aggressive skin cancer that often metastasizes early.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs of Malignancy:</h3>
        <p>Use the <strong>ABCDE</strong> rule (especially for melanoma) and be alert for these signs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New or changing mole or growth</li>
            <li>Sores that don't heal</li>
            <li>Bleeding, crusting, or oozing lesions</li>
            <li>Lesions with irregular shapes or color changes</li>
            <li>Firm nodules or rough, scaly patches</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>üîç Risk Factors:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Excessive sun exposure or tanning bed use</li>
            <li>Fair skin, light-colored eyes, and red/blonde hair</li>
            <li>Weakened immune system (e.g. organ transplant patients)</li>
            <li>Genetic predisposition (family or personal history of skin cancer)</li>
            <li>Presence of many moles or atypical moles</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>üî¨ Diagnosis:</h3>
        <p>
            Malignant lesions are diagnosed through:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Skin examination</strong> by a dermatologist</li>
            <li><strong>Biopsy</strong> ‚Äì removal of part or all of the suspicious lesion for microscopic analysis</li>
            <li>Imaging (CT, MRI, PET scans) if spread is suspected</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>üíä Treatment Options:</h3>
        <p>Treatment depends on the type, stage, and location of the cancer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Surgical excision</strong> ‚Äì complete removal of the tumor with a margin of healthy tissue</li>
            <li><strong>Mohs surgery</strong> ‚Äì specialized surgery often used for facial cancers to preserve healthy tissue</li>
            <li><strong>Radiation therapy</strong> ‚Äì especially for non-surgical candidates or certain areas like the eyelid</li>
            <li><strong>Immunotherapy</strong> ‚Äì boosts the body‚Äôs immune system to fight cancer (e.g. for advanced melanoma)</li>
            <li><strong>Targeted therapy</strong> ‚Äì drugs that specifically attack cancer cells with certain mutations</li>
            <li><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> ‚Äì less commonly used, mostly for advanced or resistant cases</li>
        </ul>
    
        
    
        <h3>üõ°Ô∏è Prevention & Monitoring:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid peak sunlight hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.)</li>
            <li>Use broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30+), even on cloudy days</li>
            <li>Wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and wide-brimmed hats</li>
            <li>Perform monthly skin self-exams</li>
            <li>Visit a dermatologist yearly for a full skin check</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>üìå Important Reminder:</h3>
        <p>
            Early detection saves lives. Always consult a healthcare professional if you notice any unusual changes in your skin.

        <h2>Benign Skin Lesions</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Benign skin lesions</strong> are non-cancerous growths or abnormalities of the skin. While they do not spread to other parts of the body or pose a serious health risk, they can resemble cancerous lesions and may require evaluation to rule out malignancy.
        </p>
    
      
    
        <h3>üß™ Diagnosis:</h3>
        <p>
            Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on appearance. However, when there is doubt, a dermatologist may perform a <strong>biopsy</strong> to ensure the lesion is not malignant. Dermoscopy (skin surface microscopy) may also be used.
        </p>
    
        <h3>ü©∫ When to Be Concerned:</h3>
        <p>
            Although benign lesions are harmless, watch for the following warning signs that could indicate a cancerous change:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rapid growth</li>
            <li>Change in color or shape</li>
            <li>Itching, bleeding, or crusting</li>
            <li>Asymmetry or irregular borders</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>üßº Treatment (if needed):</h3>
        <p>
            Treatment is often cosmetic or for comfort. Options include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cryotherapy</strong> ‚Äì Freezing the lesion off with liquid nitrogen</li>
            <li><strong>Shave excision</strong> or <strong>surgical removal</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Laser therapy</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Some lesions, like skin tags or moles, may be left alone unless irritated or aesthetically undesired.
        </p>
    
        <h3>üìå Note:</h3>
        <p>
            Self-diagnosing a skin lesion is not recommended. Always consult a dermatologist to confirm whether a spot is benign or something more serious like melanoma or another form of skin cancer.
        </p>
